  <p>Dear Governor Youngkin,</p>
  
  <p>
    I am writing to express my strong support for Senate Bill 893 (SB 893) and to respectfully urge you to sign this important piece of legislation into law. This bill, which has already passed both the Senate and the House, is a crucial step toward establishing the Residential Energy Credit (REC) program for geothermal installations in Virginia.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The REC program is not only a significant advancement for sustainable energy solutions but also an economic benefit for homeowners across our state. By incentivizing the installation of geothermal systems, SB 893 will help reduce energy costs, increase our energy independence, and contribute to a cleaner environment for future generations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a resident who cares deeply about the advancement of renewable energy initiatives, I believe that securing the REC program is a vital component of Virginiaâ€™s energy strategy. This legislation provides an opportunity for substantial progress in terms of environmental sustainability, economic growth, and energy efficiency.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I strongly urge you to support SB 893 by signing it into law. Your leadership in this effort will demonstrate a commitment to fostering a sustainable and economically prosperous future for our state.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thank you for considering this important matter. I appreciate your attention to the needs and priorities of Virginians.
  </p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>
    [Your Full Name]<br>
